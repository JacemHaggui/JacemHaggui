# Hi, I’m @JacemHaggui 👋  

I am a passionate first-year engineering student at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/), currently diving deep into the world of computer science and embedded systems.  

## 🔧 About Me  
- I enjoy building projects with **Arduino** and **Raspberry Pi**, especially **robotics** and **embedded systems**.  
- I love understanding how things work at a fundamental level, which is why I enjoy **coding**—it gives me complete control over how systems function.
- I'm most proficient in **C**, with knowledge in **Python** and **OCaml**.  

## 🌱 Current Focus  
I’m currently exploring the world of **engineering**, with a strong focus on embedded systems and **robotics**. I’m also learning the ins and outs of computer science through my academic journey.  

## 🤝 Collaboration  
I’m always excited to collaborate on projects, especially in **C** and **Python**. If you are working on something interesting or have a project that needs help, feel free to reach out!
